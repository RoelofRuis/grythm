# Grythm — Grid Rhythm Visualizer

Grythm is a small interactive demo vibe coded with Ebiten (Go) that renders moving families of grid lines. Points on the screen “ping” with a pleasant blip sound whenever a grid line passes through them. It’s a simple playground for visual rhythms and collision cues.
